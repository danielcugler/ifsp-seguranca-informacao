# About
This project helps to test the Caesar Cipher API that students created as a research in the ADS course (discipline Segurança da Informação). The students must follow the API spec available on https://danielcugler.github.io/ifsp-seguranca-informacao/cifra-cesar-api-spec/.

The server used to test it is in the project cifra-cesar-api-professor-server. Run the project in "cifra-cesar-api-professor-server", and then run this project, pointing to the other API endpoints (e.g., http://localhost:3000/cifrar and http://localhost:3000/decifrar)

# How to install
