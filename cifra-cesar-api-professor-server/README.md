# About
This project provides an API which ciphers text using the Caesar's cipher. I gave a task to students to create this API as a research in the ADS course (discipline Segurança da Informação).
I created this project only to provide me a test API where I could verify if the software that I developed in AI to test the API is working properly. 
The endpoints used in this API are http://localhost:3000/cifrar and http://localhost:3000/decifrar and http://localhost:3000/decifrarforcabruta.
The other project that can test this one is in the repository 'cifra-cesar-api-professor-tester'
